## 4. Difficulties

- Chuong Nguyen - Throughout this project, I faced many difficulties, like wrapping my head around the concept of Exploratory Data Analysis, fitting and training the computer on Linear Regression Model, and creating a workable streamlit web app. I spent many hours googling and understanding how ML works and to getting familiar with terms like hyper-parameter, EDA, pipeline, notebook, fitting, pre-processing, training, pip install, and more. Working on the project along with my school works was definitely overwhelming, but the accomplishments I achieved and the friends I made proved to be fruitful. I never regretted being part of this project. I am grateful to have Vincent Tu as my mentor along with my teammates Rohan, Rebecca, Siya, Max, and Arvin. Thank You for all of the time we spent together. Vincent, I am looking forward to being a mentee of yours again.
